CLG JavaScript Lesson 9

WORKING WITH THIRD PARTY API'S

All coding for this assignment is on contact.html and info.js.


* Choose a third party API you would like to retrieve data from
* Use Fetch API to make request to selected third party API
* Retrieve data to DOM
* Create object to access data and output on webpage

My API of choice is poetrydb.org. I chose to Fetch this particular API, to show random poems, as I felt it complimented the already existing themes of shell collecting and camping beach holidays.
